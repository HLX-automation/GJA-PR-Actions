Add Jira info to a pull request
At Contractify, we like to keeps things nice, tidy and organized. We are using Jira for our issue management and GitHub for our version control.

Since we want to have more context with our pull requests, we decided to create a GitHub action which helps us in adding Jira data to the pull request.

The current version allows you to:

Detect Jira key from the branch name
Add the Jira key as prefix to the pull request title if not present
Add the Jira key and issue title to the pull request body if not present
Assign a label to the pull request with the Jira issue type
This makes it less labour intensive for a developer to create pull requests and adds more information for the people who need to e.g. review the requests.

Sample action setup

To get started, you will need to create a GitHub action workflow file. If you need more information on how to set that up, check here.

In our repositories, we keep these actions in a separate workflow, so we usually add a file called .github/workflows/automation.yml to our repository and put the following content in there:

The on: section defines when the workflow needs to run. We ussually run them on everything that has to do with a pull request. We also use workflow_dispatch to allow us to manually trigger the workflow.

The only step which is there is the one that adds the Jira info.

We strongly suggest to store the sensitive configuration parameters as secrets.
