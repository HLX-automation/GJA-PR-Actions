Add Jira info to a pull request
At Contractify, we like to keeps things nice, tidy and organized. We are using Jira for our issue management and GitHub for our version control.

Since we want to have more context with our pull requests, we decided to create a GitHub action which helps us in adding Jira data to the pull request.

The current version allows you to:

Detect Jira key from the branch name
Add the Jira key as prefix to the pull request title if not present
Add the Jira key and issue title to the pull request body if not present
Assign a label to the pull request with the Jira issue type
This makes it less labour intensive for a developer to create pull requests and adds more information for the people who need to e.g. review the requests.
